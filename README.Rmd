Temporal disaggregation and benchmarking with JDemetra+ v3.x algorithms.

Benchmarking:

- Denton
- Cholette (incl. multi-variate)
- Cubic Splines
- GRP (Growth Rate Preservation)
- Calendarization  

Temporal disaggregation

- Chow-Lin
- Fernandez
- Litterman
- Model Based Denton
- ADL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag Models)

## Installation

Running rjd3 packages requires **Java 17 or higher**. How to set up such a configuration in R is explained [here](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/#Rconfig) 


### Latest release

To get the current stable version (from the latest release):

- From GitHub:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rjdverse/rjd3bench@*release")
```

- From [r-universe](https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev/rjd3bench):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rjd3bench", repos = c("https://rjdverse.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```


### Development version

To get the current development version from GitHub:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rjdverse/rjd3bench")
```

## Usage

First, you have to load the **{rjd3bench}** package:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library("rjd3bench")
```

### Multivariate Cholette

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
s1 <- ts(c(7, 7.2, 8.1, 7.5, 8.5, 7.8, 8.1, 8.4), frequency = 4, start = c(2010, 1))
s2 <- ts(c(18, 19.5, 19.0, 19.7, 18.5, 19.0, 20.3, 20.0), frequency = 4, start = c(2010, 1))
s3 <- ts(c(1.5, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0), frequency = 4, start = c(2010, 1))

a <- ts(c(27.1, 29.8, 29.9, 31.2, 29.3, 27.9, 30.9, 31.8), frequency = 4, start = c(2010, 1))

y1 <- ts(c(30.0, 30.6), frequency = 1, start = c(2010, 1))
y2 <- ts(c(80.0, 81.2), frequency = 1, start = c(2010, 1)) 
y3 <- ts(c(8.0, 8.1), frequency = 1, start = c(2010, 1))

data_list <- list(s1 = s1, s2 = s2, s3 = s3, a = a, y1 = y1, y2 = y2, y3 = y3)

cc <- c("a=s1+s2+s3") # contemporaneous constraints 
tc <- c("y1=sum(s1)", "y2=sum(s2)", "y3=sum(s3)") # temporal constraints

output1 <- multivariatecholette(xlist = data_list, tcvector = tc, ccvector = cc, rho = 1, lambda = .5) # = Denton
output2 <- multivariatecholette(xlist = data_list, tcvector = tc, ccvector = cc, rho = 0.729, lambda = .5) # = Cholette
output3 <- multivariatecholette(xlist = data_list, tcvector = NULL, ccvector = cc, rho = 1, lambda = .5)
```
